global models, create once for all apps using shared models

we will follow the pengin-pi-1 methodology and put all models in app/models

so app/public app will be /app/home and app/about

the models will then have /app/models/public/__init__.py

and the relationships will be /app/models/__init__.py


This will ensure easier ORM instead of going to millions of sub directories.

NOTE: It is possible to use /app/appName/models.py or /app/appName/models/__init__.py
This will still make the ORM available to the entire project, however, for ease of management,
we are migrating everything to /app/models directory.

If you want to use a third party app that already has /app/thirdParty/models, this should also be fine,
so long as you properly handle relationships in /app/models/__init__.py  and your app/thirdParty is extending the main layout or ties into the main application somehow.
